that O
the O

whose O

fell O
77 O

in O
the O
first O
10 O
months O
of O
1996 O
despite O
a O
30-percent O
rise O
in O
sales O
, O
might O
only O
post O
slightly O
better O
profits O
in O
1997 O
before O
having O
a O
chance O
to O
make O
a O
more O
significant O
turnaround O
. O
So O

Zywiec B-ORG
, O

Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
would O
not O
say O
how O
much O
higher O
1997 O
profits O
or O
market O
share O
could O
be O
but O
said O
sales O
of O
leading O
Polish B-MISC
brewers O
should O
rise O
as O
the O
country O
's O
young O
urban O
professionals O
gradually O
switch O
from O
vodka O
to O
beer O
. O
" O
The O
perspective O
on O
growth O
is O
such O
that O
reasonably O
we O
can O
think O
that O
somewhere O
between O
65 O
and O
80 O
litres O
per O
year O
is O
certainly O
reachable O
, O
" O
van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
on O
Polish B-MISC
per-capita O
beer O
consumption O
, O
currently O
around O
40 O
litres O
. O
He O
said O
the O
65-80-litre O
level O
could O
be O
reached O
in O
the O
next O
ten O
years O
and O
make O
Poland B-LOC

with O
its O
40-million O
population O
, O
Europe B-LOC

third O
largest O

market O
after O
Germany B-LOC
and O
Britain B-LOC
. O
Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
Poland B-LOC
's O
top O
five O
brewers O
, O
which O
produce O
about O
55 O
percent O
of O
the O
country O
's O
beer O
, O
could O
all O
raise O
market O
share O
as O
some O
of O
the O
numerous O
small O
brewers O
fall O
to O
competition O
from O
the O
large O
brewers O
with O
foreign O
investors O
. O
Zywiec B-ORG
is O
31.8-percent O
owned O
by O
Heineken B-ORG
while O
Carlsberg B-ORG
has O
the O

Okocim B-ORG
. O
Earlier O

South B-ORG

Breweries I-ORG

( O

bought O
strategic O
stakes O
in O
the O
unlisted O
Lech B-ORG

Tychy B-ORG
brewers O
, O
which O
together O
hold O
more O
than O
20 O

Elbrewery B-ORG
Company I-ORG
Ltd. I-ORG
( O
EB B-ORG
) O
. O
Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
the O
tough O
competition O
had O
prevented O
Zywiec B-ORG
from O
raising O
prices O
in O
line O
with O
inflation O
, O
which O
had O
added O
to O
the O
pressure O
on O
the O
firm O
's O
margins O
. O
He O
said O
advertising O
costs O
would O
also O
increase O
in O
the O
fight O
for O
market O
share O
. O
But O
he O
said O
the O
company O
's O
investment O
of O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
million O
already O
this O
decade O
, O
largely O
in O
production O
, O
would O
help O
position O
it O
to O
compete O
with O
such O
competitors O
as O
brewers O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
Czech B-LOC
Republic I-LOC
. O
Some O
analysts O
say O
cheaper O
but O
high-quality O
Czech B-MISC
imports O
could O
invade O
Poland B-LOC
once O
tariffs O
for O
CEFTA B-ORG
countries O
are O
lifted O
in O
1998 O
, O
but O
van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
says O
such O
a O
threat O
might O
be O
exaggerated O
despite O
the O
Czech B-MISC
beer O
market O
's O
overcapacity O
. O
" O
I O
think O
Polish B-MISC
consumers O
in O
general O
are O
quite O
proud O
of O
their O
beers O
-- O
and O
I O
'm O
speaking O
about O
all O
the O
brands O
-- O
and O
as O
we O
make O
good O
beers O
... O
I O
think O
that O
this O
fidelity O
to O
our O
beers O
is O
a O
factor O
which O
can O
limit O
the O
Czech B-MISC
beers O
, O
" O
he O
said O

Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
Zywiec B-ORG
had O
its O
eye O
on O
Okocim B-ORG
, O
which O
has O
said O
it O
would O
start O
producing O
Carlsberg B-ORG
beer O
next O
year O
, O
but O
that O
Zywiec B-ORG
's O
potential O
production O
of O
Heineken B-ORG
was O
a O
medium-term O
possibility O
rather O
than O
a O
short-term O
one O
. O
He O
said O
his O
firm O
would O
be O
better O
off O
concentrating O
on O
its O
leading O
brand O
, O
Zywiec B-ORG
Full B-MISC
Light I-MISC
, O
which O
accounts O
for O
85 O
percent O
of O
sales O
and O
is O
the O
country O

largest-selling O
brand O
. O
" O
You O
will O
not O

that O

remain O
an O

in O

Van B-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
also O
said O
Zywiec B-ORG
would O
be O
boosted O
by O
its O
recent O

only O
accounted O
for O

three O
