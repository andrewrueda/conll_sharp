he O
would O
not O

, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa B-LOC
and O
the O
Zairean B-MISC
rebels O
who O
control O

the O

told O
him O
the O
crisis O

over O
because O
most O
of O
the O

already O

The O

do O
not O

In O

the O
European B-ORG

called O
on O
Singapore B-LOC

Supple B-PER
said O
the O
struggle O
that O
Singapore B-LOC
had O
to O
wage O
in O
vying O
to O
host O
the O

would O
be O
repeated O
during O
the O
talks O

" O
There O
is O
tension O
at O
every O
step O
of O
the O
way O
, O
" O
since O
a O
battle O
line O
between O
the O
West B-LOC

developing O
countries O
has O
been O
drawn O
over O
the O
issue O

Supple B-PER
said O
hosting O
the O
meeting O
carried O
prestige O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
, O
" O
however O
, O
this O
is O
quite O
intangible O
as O
the O
prestige O
factor O
may O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
any O
additional O
investment O
and O
trade O
flows O
to O
this O
region O
. O
" O
 
From O
a O
commercial O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
meeting O
would O
be O
good O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
tourism O
industry O
, O
Tan B-PER
said O
. O
 
A O
large O
part O
of O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
workforce O
would O
be O
mobilised O
to O
ensure O
the O
meeting O
would O
run O
without O
a O
glitch O
but O
the O
average O
Singaporean B-MISC
" O
would O
probably O
not O
be O
too O
concerned O
about O
some O
of O
the O
issues O
, O
" O
Tan B-PER
said O
. O
 
" O
But O
the O
more O
educated O
public O
will O
realise O
that O
these O
kind O
of O
things O
are O
important O
for O
Singapore B-LOC
as O
a O
small O
economy O
. O
" O
 
Supple B-PER
said O
any O
political O
gains O
the O
Singapore B-LOC
government O
would O
get O
from O
the O
WTO B-ORG
meeting O
-- O
ahead O
of O
a O
general O
election O
due O
by O
April O
1997 O
-- O
would O
depend O
on O
how O
successful O
it O
was O
in O
pushing O
its O
economic O
agenda O
. O
 
" O
If O
there O
are O
any O
movements O
toward O
freer O
trade O
, O
then O
Singapore B-LOC
's O
economy O
and O
the O
electorate O
would O
gain O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O
 
But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
wise B-ORG
to O
play O
up O
the O
political O
aspect O
of O
this O
. O
 
I O
think O
political O
issues O
will O
take O
secondary O
importance O
to O
all O
these O
economic O
issues O
that O
will O
be O
displayed O
