This repo provides the scripts used for evaluating the chosen SOTA NER models on the CoNLL# test set, primarily using [Seqscore](https://github.com/bltlab/seqscore).

F1 scores are found across the full test set, as well as across the document domains (SPORTS, WORLD EVENTS, ECONOMY) and document formats (TEXT ARTICLE, DATA REPORT, HYBRID).
